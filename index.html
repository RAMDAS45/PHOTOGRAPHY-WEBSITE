            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I am Yash Morye 23yrs old currently I am working as a financial analyst simultaneously studying as well.Talking about myself  there are four members in my family including me . As my experience of overall life is that life is a journey where we explore many things the nature, peoples,and childhood which wouldn't be put into words.As a observer and keen to learn about nature and it's imprtance I had started to capture moment's surroundings to me whether it is nature , wildlife or random photoshoots. <br> <br>I had started my photography journey whe I was 16 yr old  I was learning new things, 
                The only reason I had started photography because capturing moments gives my life a good angle.Photography is the way to be alone in crowd as well doing our own things without being judged.One of the most important lesson I had learned is doing nothing but capturing moments which will be memories one day and what if the memories last by seeing those moments of happiness.
                For me photography is what we are from inside keen to know by others when we capture .</p>
